       Tiger Woods has been the most recognizable golfer in the world for more than 20 years, so it was easy for me to aspire to be like him as I started playing golf. He is a positive role model, showing that any adversity can be overcome. More recently, Tiger has inspired millons with his epic comeback after several major back surgeries.

        Tiger Woods has shown me, as well as an entire generation of golfers, that greatness can be achieved no matter how heavily the odds are stacked against you. Whether it's winning a major championship on a broken leg or simply getting out of bed, Tiger has shown me that there can be greatness in anything.
